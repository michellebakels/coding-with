# Coding With...
Coding With... is a collection of emotional expressions through tiny software programs. As a contribution to the 10 for 10 challenge created by the [South Florida Entrepreneur Club](https://www.sfle.club/), the aim is to meditate on a new theme daily as small, personal tributes are created for each through code.
